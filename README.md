This Repository is a part of a small Web-Dev project.
This project is built from scratch using HTML and CSS. CSS Properties like flexbox, keyframes and animations are extensively used.


# 1.)The homepage of the TasteIndia looks something like this.

The toughest task of the whole page was the footer page. It has extensive usage of the **flexbox-property**. The whole of the footer was designed taking motivation from an external website [*orgafe*](https://shtheme.com/demosd/orgafe/). The CSS of the footer consists of almost equal number of lines as much as that of the whole other sections combined have.
